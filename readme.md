## About the Original Fooocus

Fooocus is an image generating software (based on [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) <a href='https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio'><img src='https://img.shields.io/github/stars/gradio-app/gradio'></a>).

Fooocus presents a rethinking of image generator designs. The software is offline, open source, and free, while at the same time, similar to many online image generators like Midjourney, the manual tweaking is not needed, and users only need to focus on the prompts and images.
